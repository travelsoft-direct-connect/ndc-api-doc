## What is the Travelsoft API NDC ?
The Travelsoft API NDC provides programmatic acces to airline content based on IATA's New Distribution Capability (NDC) standard. NDC is a travel industry-supported program launched by IATA for the development and market adoption of a new XML-based data transmission standard between airlines and travel agents.
